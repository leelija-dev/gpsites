                    GPsites, its suppliers, or licensors are not responsible or liable with respect to any subject matter of
                    this Terms of Service agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability,
                    or other legal or similar theory for any special, incidental, or consequential damage. We are also not
                    responsible for the costs if you need to purchase substitute services, for interruption
                    in usage, loss, or corruption of your data, or for any amount that exceeds the service charges paid by
                    you on the platform of GPsites.io under these Terms of Service during the
                    twelve (12) month period before the cause of action. GPsites will not be liable by any means for any
                    failure or delay in services due to factors that are reasonably not under our own control.
                    If a law prevents this Agreement or statement from being enforced, the law wins, and the statement is
                    ignored or modified to follow the law.

                    These Terms of Service, policies, or operating rules posted by us on this website or in respect to the
                    site are the entire agreement between you and us. We can still enforce rules and regulations later,
                    even if we have missed one before or did not enforce them previously. The rules, terms, and policies are
                    valid as much as the law allows. We may assign any or all of these rights and obligations to someone
                    else at any point in time. We are not liable or responsible for issues (loss, damage, delay, and failure
                    to act on time) caused by events that are not under our direct control (Acts of God, such as power
                    outages,
                    natural disasters, or major tech failures).

                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                    If any single part of these Terms of Service is found to be unlawful, invalid, or unenforceable, that
                    specific part can be separated from these Terms of Service, and the rest of this will remain valid and
                    legally enforceable.

                    The fact that you use our website for specific purposes does not establish or create any formal business
                    relationship, partnership, employer-employee relationship, or any form of agency between you and
                    GPsites.io. By accepting these
                    Terms of Service, you agree not to challenge the validity of the stated terms and conditions about our
                    platform usage simply because they are in electronic format or lack physical signatures, and you agree
                    not to argue that these terms
                    should be interpreted against GPsites simply because we drafted them.
